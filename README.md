### The Problem

You are given a ring of integers like the one shown below. The number of integers in the ring is a multiple of 3. You start of with a total of 0. Until all the numbers are gone, choose 3 integers in a row in the ring, multiply them together, and add the product of them to your total.

Your code should find the highest possible total possible by following these rules.
You can see example games below.
